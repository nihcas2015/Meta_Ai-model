# Meta AI Supervisor System
A Multi-Agent, Multi-Domain AI Planning & Documentation Framework

## 📌 Overview
The Meta AI Supervisor System is a unified, multi-agent AI framework designed to analyze, plan, and generate complete project documentation across multiple engineering and technical domains.

The system accepts a user-defined project idea and delegates analysis to domain-specific AI agents (Mechanical, Electrical, and Software/Programming). A central Meta AI Supervisor coordinates these agents, evaluates their outputs, identifies potential flaws, and finalizes a consolidated decision.

Additional specialized agents are used to generate presentation slides (PPT), flow diagrams, images, and structured reports. The system runs entirely locally using Ollama with the llama3.2 model.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### Meta AI Supervisor
- Acts as the central decision-making authority
- Communicates with all domain agents
- Evaluates feasibility, risks, and inconsistencies
- Produces a final, unified project plan

### Domain-Specific Agents
Each domain agent receives a structured prompt generated by the Meta AI Supervisor.

Mechanical Domain Agent:
- Physical feasibility
- Structural and mechanical constraints
- Design limitations and risks

Electrical Domain Agent:
- Power and circuit feasibility
- Component selection
- Safety considerations

Programming / Software Agent:
- Software architecture
- Algorithms and technology stack
- Implementation challenges

Each agent returns:
- Domain-specific solution
- Potential flaws and risks
- Improvement suggestions

---

## 🔗 Multi-Agent Workflow
1. User submits a project idea
2. Meta AI Supervisor generates prompts for each domain
3. Domain agents independently analyze the project
4. Each agent reports solutions and flaws
5. Meta AI Supervisor aggregates responses and finalizes decisions
6. Final decisions are passed to:
   - PPT generation agent
   - Image generation agent
   - Flow diagram generation agent
7. Outputs are generated and stored

---

## ⚙️ Configuration
Edit config.json to customize model behavior:
{
  "system": {
    "model": "llama3.2",
    "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
    "temperature": 0.7
  }
}

---

## 🌐 API Mode 
Run the Flask API:
python meta_system_api.py

POST request to:
http://localhost:5000/api/analyze

Request body:
{
  "query": "Your project idea"
}

---

## 📤 Output
All generated outputs are stored in the data directory:
- analysis_<session_id>.json : Structured multi-domain analysis
- report_<session_id>.pdf : Final consolidated report
- PPT files, images, and flow diagrams (if enabled)
