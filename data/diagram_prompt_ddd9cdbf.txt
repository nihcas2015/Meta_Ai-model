**Optimized Prompt for Architecture Diagram Generator**

Create an architecture diagram that showcases the autonomous delivery robot's design, incorporating the following key components and functionalities:

1.  **Robot Body:** Represented as a rectangular box with a secure compartment at the front, capable of carrying payloads up to 5kg.
2.  **Navigation System:**
    *   A combination of lidar sensors for accurate navigation and computer vision algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance.
3.  **Power Source:** An efficient battery system that provides at least 8 hours of operation on a single charge.
4.  **Touchscreen Interface:** Integrated into the robot's control system, allowing users to interact with the device via a user-friendly interface.
5.  **Integration with Building Systems:**
    *   Direct integration with elevators and automatic doors for seamless navigation.

**Diagram Type:** System Architecture Diagram

**Notation and Symbols:**

*   Use standard UML notation and symbols for classes, objects, and relationships.
*   Represent the robot's body as a rectangular box with a secure compartment.
*   Show the navigation system as a combination of lidar sensors and computer vision algorithms.
*   Illustrate the power source as an efficient battery system.
*   Display the touchscreen interface as a user-friendly interaction model.
*   Represent the integration with building systems using standard UML notation.

**Component Relationships and Data Flows:**

1.  **Payload Carrying:** The robot's body is connected to the payload, which is carried by the robot's wheels or a separate carrying mechanism.
2.  **Navigation:** The navigation system provides data to the control system, which uses this information to determine the robot's movement.
3.  **Power Source:** The power source provides energy to the control system and other components.
4.  **Touchscreen Interface:** The touchscreen interface receives input from users and sends commands to the control system.

**Scalability and Maintainability:**

1.  **Modular Design:** Use a modular design approach to facilitate easy maintenance and upgrades.
2.  **Standardized Components:** Use standardized components whenever possible to simplify integration with other systems.
3.  **Flexibility:** Incorporate flexibility into the design to accommodate changing requirements or new technologies.

**Design Considerations:**

1.  **Safety:** Ensure the robot's design prioritizes safety, including features like obstacle avoidance and secure compartment.
2.  **Efficiency:** Optimize the robot's power consumption and energy efficiency for extended operation times.
3.  **User Experience:** Design a user-friendly interface that provides an intuitive experience for users.

**Previous Agent Work:**

1.  **Autonomous Navigation:** Leverage insights from previous agents' work on autonomous navigation, such as lidar sensor integration and computer vision algorithms.
2.  **Building System Integration:** Build upon the knowledge gained from integrating with building systems, ensuring seamless communication between the robot and the infrastructure.

By incorporating these recommendations, the generated architecture diagram will effectively showcase the autonomous delivery robot's design, highlighting its key components and functionalities while emphasizing scalability, maintainability, and user experience.
