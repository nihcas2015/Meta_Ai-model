Analyze this requirement from your programming engineering perspective:

USER REQUIREMENT:

    We need to design an autonomous delivery robot for indoor environments like hospitals and offices.
    The robot should be able to navigate corridors, avoid obstacles, carry payloads of up to 5kg,
    and operate for at least 8 hours on a single charge. It should have a secure compartment
    for delivering items and a touchscreen interface for user interaction. The robot needs to
    integrate with building systems like elevators and automatic doors.
    





Provide your analysis in this format:
1. Core principles and considerations from your domain
2. Key concerns and potential issues
3. Specific recommendations and approaches

Be thorough, technical, and focus exclusively on programming engineering aspects.
